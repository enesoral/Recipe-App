## Working with Recipe App in your IDE

### Prerequisites
The following items should be installed in your system:
* Java 8 or newer.
* Your preferred IDE.

## Database configuration

In its default configuration, Recipe App uses an in-memory database (H2) which
gets populated at startup with data. The h2 console is automatically exposed at `http://localhost:8080/h2-console`
and it is possible to inspect the content of the database using the `jdbc:h2:mem:testdb` url.
